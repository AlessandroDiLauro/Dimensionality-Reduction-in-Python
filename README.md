	<h1>t-SNE vs PCA</h1>
	<p>Are you struggling to choose between t-SNE and PCA for your data analysis? Let's explore the differences!</p>
	<h2>PCA</h2>
	<p>PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a linear method for dimensionality reduction that finds the principal components of the data, which are the axes that capture the most variance in the data. It projects the data onto these principal components, reducing the dimensionality of the data. PCA is great for finding the most important dimensions of your data.</p>
	<h2>t-SNE</h2>
	<p>t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a non-linear method that finds a low-dimensional representation of the data that preserves the pairwise distances between the data points as much as possible. It is particularly good at visualizing clusters and identifying outliers. t-SNE is ideal for visualizing high-dimensional data and identifying clusters.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>PCA and t-SNE are both useful techniques for data analysis, but they have different strengths. Choose PCA if you want to find the most important dimensions of your data and reduce dimensionality, and choose t-SNE if you want to visualize high-dimensional data and identify clusters.</p>
